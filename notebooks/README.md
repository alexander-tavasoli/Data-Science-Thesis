## Analyzing Reanalysis Data

A notebook to compare the different reanalysis datasets between themselves. Because we use reanalysis datasets as our "truth" in forecasting, it is important to know how correlated the reanalysis datasets are to each other, given that they all come from independent groups performing their own reconstructions of past temperature data. 

## Forecast and Reanalysis Comparison

This notebook shows how the forecast datasets (NMME, CFS, and SEAS) compare to a given reanalysis dataset (what we treat as truth). Will allow for output of correlation and RMSE plots to be stored in the outputs folder. 

## analysis_utils.py

A python script with functions that help preprocess the data for analysis.
