## Forecasts 

A folder that contains all of the forecast data. There should be environment variables linked to each of the subc=folders of Forecasts: NMME, CFS, and SEAS. These forecasts come from NOAA and ECMWF.

## Reanalysis

Reconstructions of past temperature data for the globe. Just like in the Forecasts folder, there should be environment variables linked to each of the subfolders: Berkeley_Earth, ERA-5, and NCEP_Reanalysis_2. 

## Grid_Data

A folder containing empty netCDF files meant to establish a default grid for preprocessing purposes. After connecting environment variables to the folder, do not modify either grid_area.nc or main_grid.nc
